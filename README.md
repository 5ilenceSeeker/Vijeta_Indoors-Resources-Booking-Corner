# Indoors Resources Booking with optimal distribution and management features

# Introduction


Designed with these following main objectives:-
1. To reduce the physical efforts in accessing the sports fields and equipment .
2. The Sport facility booking application enables students and staff to save their time
and increase convenience to book the sport facility and equipment. They just choose
the required available time slot by clicking a few buttons then to complete the
booking process.
3. It provides the better utilization of sports resources
4. In this project we have 2 modules, admin and student/staff.
The students can booked the sport fields with an ease according to their choices. Though the
distribution of the resources is balanced, in some un-preferable cases,the bookings will get
restricted also with a proper notification The admins are the coordinators and supervisors with
varying levels of control. They will coordinate the whole application . Like from the login into
system to creating new booking entries and updating them .The coordinators accept the feedback
regarding the application and pass it on to the supervisors who can resolve the issues.
5.Five sub modules are there for 4 different sports and one for previous history and
bookings check.
6.Also Resources distributions will be facilitated as well for proper functioning of
the application.

## Problem Description
Very Often, sports venues have such problems as places idled, venues are filled at the high
time of movement, which greatly affects the practical efficiency of sports venues resources
and increases the management burden to venues.
Moreover, during any mega sports events the facilities are limited to some extent, resulting
in a lot of chaos in event organization and management. Therefore, with the rapid
development of information technology, college sports venues are realizing the need of a
new online booking trend.


## Proposed Solution
To develop a system with following Objectives:-
1.To develop a mono controlled application for the fore-said purpose, to avoid unauthentic
usage of resources.
2.The Sport facility booking application enables students and staff to save their time and
increase convenience to book the sport facility and equipment. They just choose the
required available time slot by clicking a few buttons then to complete the booking
process.
3. To develop a viewable time slot to display status of the sport facility or equipment.
4. It provides the better utilization of sports resources .Though the distribution of the
resources is balanced, in some un-preferable cases,the bookings will get restricted also with
a proper notification


##  User Requirements
1.The user should be able to book a sport venue based on a particular category and on
particular date,time etc.
2.The user should be able to check for all the empty available slots to make it easy for the
booking process.
3.The user should be able to check out the resources distributions based on a particular
category.
4.To prevent un-preferable bookings, the system should respond likewise and also a
coordinator will be coordinating the whole process.
